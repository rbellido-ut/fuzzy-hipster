fuzzy-hipster
=============

This hipster is so fuzzy it can play music...on the network..on wandows

Note: will change the name to windows audio or something later on when we're done this assignment. 
Just wanted to obscure the name to avoid people looking into our code. Security through obscurity amirite?! Or
we're just way too hipsters that our application is underground right now, just before it becomes mainstream on April.

Anyway...

TODO - Updated at least once weekly!
-----
####Week of Feb 18####
  - [ ] @everyone, Create your own separate folder where you will upload your windows a2 source code. We will
  decide this week whose code we will work on and improve on as a group. On the other hand, we could also
  rewrite the entire networking layer of our project.
  - [ ] @anyone, WALP. Our biggest objective is obviously the networking part of this assignment. If you
  are keen and aren't tired of wandows and totally love it to bits (pun totally intended), then I would suggest 
  creating little, simple applications. 
  **We are going to use Completion Routines to implement our networking component.**
  So I suggest getting familiar with those even if you did or didn't use it on the previous assignment.
  - [ ] @everyone, Study the assignment specifications, the notes on milliways, and ask questions. 
  Start thinking about the design and contribute your ideas to the team.
