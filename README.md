fuzzy-hipster
=============

This hipster is so fuzzy it can play music...on the network..on wandows

Note: will change the name to windows audio or something later on when we're done this assignment. 
Just wanted to obscure the name to avoid people looking into our code. Security through obscurity amirite?! Or
we're just way too hipsters that our application is underground right now, just before it becomes mainstream on April.

Anyway...
